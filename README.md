# Analyzing the Relationship between Sustainability Reporting Policies and Maersk's Sustainability Performances

## Project Overview
This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and findings related to the study of sustainability performance in the maritime industry, with a specific focus on Maersk. The project investigates the correlation between Maersk's emission levels and the 2014/95/EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the Taxonomy Regulation, utilizing regression analysis.

## Contents
- `Maersk_PoS_7Dec2023.ipynb`: The primary code in Jupyter Notebook format.
- `Maersk_PoS_7Dec2023_TNT.py`: Python scripts, performing visualization and regression analysis.
- `Maersk Data_General.csv`: The main dataset for analysis.
- `Bloomberg_Maersk_clean.csv`: Datasets for analyzing external indicators (Bloomberg ESG).
- `Maersk_PoS_Cleaned_Dataset_Taufik.csv`: A comprehensive dataset that has already been transposed.
- `Shipping Values - BI_SHIPG_1_MAERSK_SHIPPING VALUES/`: A dataset comprising shipping volumes and revenues from Maersk.

## Key Findings
- The regression analysis investigates the correlation between policy implementation and emissions indicators, such as SOx, NOx, and GHG Scope 1.
- Visual trends suggest a decrease in emissions after 2018, with a significant decline associated with the introduction of policies in 2020.
