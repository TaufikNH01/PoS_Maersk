# Analyzing the Relationship between Sustainability Reporting Policies and Maersk's Sustainability Performances

## Project Overview
This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and findings related to the study of sustainability performance in the maritime industry, with a specific focus on Maersk. It investigates the correlation of the 2014/95/EU (NFRD) and the Taxonomy Regulation on Maersk's emission levels, utilizing regression analysis.

## Contents
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: R and Python scripts for performing the regression analysis.
- `results/`: Normalized trends, regression tables, and graphs illustrating the findings.
- `appendix/`: Supplementary materials and additional data sources.
  
## Key Findings
- The regression analysis investigates the correlation between policy implementation and emissions indicators such as SOx, NOx, and GHG Scope 1.
- Visual trends suggest a decrease in emissions post-2018, with a marked decline associated with the 2020 policy introduction.
